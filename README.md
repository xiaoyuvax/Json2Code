# JsonCode
Convert Json to C#, VB.Net, Javascript, PHP, TypeScrip and SQL Server Table.

Based on codes from [Json Class Generator](https://jsonclassgenerator.codeplex.com/) , but this site is down already. The link here shows respect to the original author.

## Recent Changes:
  [20240612]  
 - Migrated to Net8.0 and C# 12
 - Correct conversion of generic Dictionary<string,T> type.
 - Optimization and cleanup of the code.
 - Remove JsonUtils MVC project from the upstream, cos i want this repo to be a neat tool for conversion codes locally.
